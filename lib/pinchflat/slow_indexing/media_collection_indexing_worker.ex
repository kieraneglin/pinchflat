  @doc """
  The ID is that of a source _record_, not a YouTube channel/playlist ID. Indexes
  the provided source, kicks off downloads for each new MediaItem, and
  reschedules the job to run again in the future. It will ALWAYS index a source
  if it's never been indexed before or if `force` is set to `true`, but rescheduling
  is determined by the `index_frequency_minutes` field.

  README: Re-scheduling here works a little different than you may expect.
  The reschedule time is relative to the time the job has actually _completed_.
  This has some benefits but also side effects to be aware of:

  - Benefit: No chance for jobs to overlap if a job takes longer than the
    scheduled interval. Less likely to hit API rate limits.
  - Side effect: Intervals are "soft" and _always_ walk forward. This may cause
    user confusion since a 30-minute job scheduled for every hour will
    actually run every 1 hour and 30 minutes. The tradeoff of not inundating
    the API with requests and also not overlapping jobs is worth it, IMO.

  Order of operations:
    1. The user saves a source
    2. This job is automatically scheduled immediately. This happens in all cases.
    3. This job indexes all content for the given source. A download job is
       enqueued for each media item that should be downloaded. This can be impacted
       by the `download_media` field on the source as well as the profile's
       shorts/livestream behaviour. At this step we also attach a file reader
       to the `yt-dlp` output file so we can create media items as they come in
       for a little speedup (see {Fast,Slow}IndexingHelpers comments for more)
    4. If this job is meant to reschedule (ie: has an index frequency > 0),
       it reschedules itself. If not, it runs once and does not reschedule
    5. If the source uses fast indexing, that job is kicked off as well. It
       uses RSS to run a smaller, faster, and more frequent index. That job
       handles rescheduling itself but largely has a similar behaviour to this
       job in that it runs and index and maybe kicks off media download jobs.
       Check out `FastIndexingWorker` comments for more.
    6. If the job reschedules, the cycle from step 3 repeats until the heat death
       of the universe. The user changing things like the index frequency can
       dequeue or reschedule jobs as well

  NOTE: Since indexing can take a LONG time, I should check what happens if an
  application restart occurs while a job is running. Will the job be lost?
