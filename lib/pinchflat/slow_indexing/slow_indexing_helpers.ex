  Given a media source, creates (indexes) the media by creating media_items for each
  media ID in the source. Afterward, kicks off a download task for each pending media
  item belonging to the source. You can't tell me the method name isn't descriptive!
  Returns a list of media items or changesets (if the media item couldn't be created).

  Indexing is slow and usually returns a list of all media data at once for record creation.
  To help with this, we use a file follower to watch the file that yt-dlp writes to
  so we can create media items as they come in. This parallelizes the process and adds
  clarity to the user experience. This has a few things to be aware of which are documented
  below in the file watcher setup method.

  NOTE: downloads are only enqueued if the source is set to download media. Downloads are
  also enqueued for ALL pending media items, not just the ones that were indexed in this
  job run. This should ensure that any stragglers are caught if, for some reason, they
  weren't enqueued or somehow got de-queued.

  Since indexing returns all media data EVERY TIME, we that that opportunity to update
  indexing metadata for media items that have already been created.

  Returns [%MediaItem{} | %Ecto.Changeset{}]

  # of any media items that were missed/initially failed.
