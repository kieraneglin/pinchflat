  Deletes files that are no longer needed by a media item.

  This means that if a media item has been updated, the old and new versions
  can be passed and any files that are no longer needed will be deleted.

  An example is a video that gets its quality upgraded and its name changes
  between original download and re-download. The old file will exist on-disk
  with the old name but the database entry will point to the new file. This
  function can be used to delete the old file in this case.

  Returns :ok
