  @doc """
  The ID is that of a source _record_, not a YouTube channel/playlist ID. Indexes
  the provided source, kicks off downloads for each new MediaItem, and
  reschedules the job to run again in the future. It will ALWAYS index a source
  if it's never been indexed before, but rescheduling is determined by the
  `index_frequency_minutes` field.

  README: Re-scheduling here works a little different than you may expect.
  The reschedule time is relative to the time the job has actually _completed_.
  This has some benefits but also side effects to be aware of:

  - Benefit: No chance for jobs to overlap if a job takes longer than the
    scheduled interval. Less likely to hit API rate limits.
  - Side effect: Intervals are "soft" and _always_ walk forward. This may cause
    user confusion since a 30-minute job scheduled for every hour will
    actually run every 1 hour and 30 minutes. The tradeoff of not inundating
    the API with requests and also not overlapping jobs is worth it, IMO.

  NOTE: Since indexing can take a LONG time, I should check what happens if an
  application restart occurs while a job is running. Will the job be lost?

  IDEA: Should I use paging and do indexing in chunks? Is that even faster?

  Returns :ok | {:ok, %Task{}}
