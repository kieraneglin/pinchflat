  Starts tasks for downloading videos for any of a sources _pending_ media items.
  Jobs are not enqueued if the source is set to not download media. This will return :ok.

  NOTE: this starts a download for each media item that is pending,
  not just the ones that were indexed in this job run. This should ensure
  that any stragglers are caught if, for some reason, they weren't enqueued
  or somehow got de-queued.

  I'm not sure of a case where this would happen, but it's cheap insurance.
