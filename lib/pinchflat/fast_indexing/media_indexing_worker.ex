  @doc """
  Similar to `MediaCollectionIndexingWorker`, but for individual media items.
  Does not reschedule or check anything to do with a source's indexing
  frequency - only collects initial metadata then kicks off a download.
  `MediaCollectionIndexingWorker` should be preferred in general, but this is
  useful for downloading one-off media items based on a URL (like for fast indexing).

  Only downloads media that _should_ be downloaded (ie: the source is set to download
  and the media matches the profile's format preferences)

  Order of operations:
    1. FastIndexingHelpers.kickoff_indexing_tasks_from_youtube_rss_feed/1 (which is running
       in its own worker) periodically checks the YouTube RSS feed for new media
    2. If new media is found, it enqueues a MediaIndexingWorker (this module) for each new media
       item
    3. This worker fetches the media metadata and uses that to determine if it should be
       downloaded. If so, it enqueues a MediaDownloadWorker

  Each is a worker because they all either need to be scheduled periodically or call out to
  an external service and will be long-running. They're split into different jobs to separate
  retry logic for each step and allow us to better optimize various queues (eg: the indexing
  steps can keep running while the slow download steps are worked through).

  Returns :ok
