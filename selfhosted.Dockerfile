# NEVER do this if you're running in an environment where you don't trust the user
# (ie: most environments). This is only acceptable in a self-hosted environment.
# The user could just run the whole container as root and bypass this anyway so
# it's not a huge deal.
# This removes the root password to allow users to assume root if needed. This is
# preferrable to running the whole container as root so that the files/directories
# created by the app aren't owned by root and are therefore easier for other users
# and processes to interact with. If you want to just run the whole container as
# root, use --user 0:0 or something.

# If using an environment that doesn't automatically reap zombie processes, it is

# above and adding an entrypoint. See https://github.com/krallin/tini for details
