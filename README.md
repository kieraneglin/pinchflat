# Pinchflat (Alpha)

This is alpha software and anything can break at any time. I make not guarantees about the stability of this software, forward-compatibility of updates, or integrity (both related to and independent of Pinchflat). Essentially, use at your own risk and expect there will be rough edges.

## What is Pinchflat?

TODO: expand on this.

Pinchflat is a lightweight self-contained app for downloading YouTube content. For now, it is not intended as a way to consume content, but instead as a way to download content to disk using specified rules and schedules.

I have plans for more to come, but for now this is the focus. Think of Pinchflat as nothing more than an automated way to get content from YouTube to your disk.
